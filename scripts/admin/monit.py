'''
This package manages the interface to monit for the set of services
managed by this instance of sirikata-sample-deployment (ideally just
this one per node).  It's preferable to collect all services under a
single monit daemon, with a single config. This module manages getting
services into that config, removing them, and working with the monit
daemon.

To avoid having to deal with databases, we just generate a config file
and use blocks labelled with the corresponding service name in a
comment so we can pick them out for update/removal. You can find the
config file in data/monit.rc
